# Hardcore Skript

Hello! This is a hardcore-like Skript created for [/u/TheBus4k](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBus4K) on Reddit based on the specifications posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/u0g1l7/hardcore_plugin_with_x_amount_of_lives_and_when/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

The Skript is fairly simple. You and your friends start out with 3 lives altogether. When one person dies, the life counter goes down. When you reach 0 lives everyones inventory gets cleared and they are all set to adventure mode.



## Dependencies
To run this Skript you will need the following plugins. These are all included with the download:
- [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases) (duh)

- [Skellet](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skript-java-addon-skellett.34361/)
- [skRayFall](https://sk.rayfall.net/)

## Commands/Items
To gain more lives, you can craft the +1 apple, which is 4 diamond blocks and 4 emerald blocks surrounding a non-enchanted golden apple. (This is subject to change depending on TheBus4k's thoughts).
